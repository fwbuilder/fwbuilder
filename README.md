fwbuilder
=========

Firewall Builder is a GUI firewall management application for iptables, PF, Cisco ASA/PIX/FWSM, Cisco router ACL and more. Firewall configuration data is stored in a central file that can scale to hundreds of firewalls managed from a single UI.


Installation instructions
=========================


Ubuntu
---------

The instructions are inspired by the well-meaning but out of date instructions available from the fwbuilder.org website: http://www.fwbuilder.org/4.0/docs/users_guide5/compile_from_source.shtml

run the following apt-get install command to install the compile requirements:

```
 sudo apt-get install git automake autoconf libtool libxml2-dev libxslt-dev libsnmp-dev qt5-default qttools5-dev-tools
 git clone https://github.com/fwbuilder/fwbuilder.git
 cd fwbuilder
 ./autogen.sh
 make
 sudo make install
```
Then, if you are lucky, you should be able to type
```
 fwbuilder &
```
At the prompt and get it to run. There is also a GUI icon you can use to start the program.
