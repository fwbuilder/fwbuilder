## To be able to make changes to the part of configuration created
## from this configlet you need to copy this file to the directory
## fwbuilder/configlets/sveasoft/ in your home directory and modify it.
## Double "##" comments are removed during processing but single "#"

## Configlets support simple macro language with these constructs:
## {{$var}} is variable expansion
## {{if var}} is conditional operator.

## This configlet defines commands executed when iptables script is ran
## with command line argument "status". Exit codes are defined in
## http://refspecs.freestandards.org/LSB_3.1.0/LSB-Core-generic/LSB-Core-generic/iniscrptact.html
## Script should return with exit code 0 if iptables rules are loaded and 
## 1 otherwise. We can not verify that the rules running at the moment
## are those configured in this script so we only check if some rules
## exist by checking if any tables are defined.
