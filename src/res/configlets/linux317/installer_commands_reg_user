## These are commands built-in policy installer runs on the firewall if
## installation is performed using regular user account for authentication
##
##  Variables:
##
##  {{$fwbprompt}} -- "magic" prompt that installer uses to detect when it is logged in
##  {{$fwdir}}     -- directory on the firewall
##  {{$fwscript}}  -- script name on the firewall
##  {{$rbtimeout}} -- rollback timeout
##
##  {{$firewall_name}} -- the name of the firewall object
##
##  Note: all commands should be on one line to avoid unnecessary linefeeds.
##  These linefeeds are sent to the server side (to the firewall) and end up
##  on the input of sudo and other commands. This creates difficult to catch
##  race condition which breaks installation process.
