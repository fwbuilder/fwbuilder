## Configlets support simple macro language with these constructs:
## {{$var}} is variable expansion
## {{if var}} is conditional operator.

## This configlet defines commands executed when iptables script is ran
## with command line argument "block". By default it resets iptables 
## tables and chains using function reset_all and optionally adds backup
## ssh access rules.

block_action() {
    reset_all

## it helps to add backup ssh access rule as early as possible so that
## ssh session opened from the management station won't break after
## all chains are flushed. The installation process may stall if
## stdout buffer gets filled with diagnostic or progress output from
## this script printed after chains are flushed but before a rule
## permitting ssh is installed. This may happen if script debugging is
## on or there are many NAT rules (so it prints a lot of "Rule NN
## (NAT)" lines).
